# About badreads 📚 # 

Out of the frustation that 1) goodreads doesn't give out API access anymore and 2) the platform has very skewed ratings for (what I consider) generally bad books, I thought it would be fun to create my own web app that focused on creating a space for people to honestly spill the "tea" on their bad reads!

This project is still in its early stages and I'm using it as a way to continue flexing my full stack coding skills to become more comfortable with building back-end to front-end features. 

## TECH USED 👩🏽‍💻 ##
- JavaScript
- React.js
- Redux
- Redux Thunk
- Knex.js
- SQLite3
- Boilerplate from Dev Academy Aotearoa!

## NEXT STEPS ▶️ ##
- [ ] Deploy! 
- [ ] Refactor code
- [ ] Add authentication for users to sign in
- [ ] Add new routes for profile pages
- [ ] Add comment/review section
- [ ] Explore more APIs for integration
